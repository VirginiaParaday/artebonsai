    "historia_p1": "My encounter with bonsai was almost casual, but it ended up marking a deep path in my life. During a professional visit to a client — owner of a well-known hair salon — my attention was drawn to a corner of his business: there rested small trees that, despite their size, conveyed the majesty of great forests. It was like contemplating giants in miniature, ancient and solemn.",
    "historia_p2": "That first impression wrapped me in a unique feeling, as if nature had compressed itself into delicate and perfect forms. My client, a passionate bonsai grower, shared his enthusiasm with me and conveyed the idea that each tree is a work of patience and art. Since then, he became my guide in this fascinating world, teaching me techniques, care and above all, the philosophy behind each bonsai.",
    "historia_p3": "That is how my journey began: from initial curiosity to constant dedication, finding in bonsai not just a hobby, but a space of calm and connection with nature.",
    "h2_filosofia": "My philosophy with bonsai",
    "filosofia_p1": "Caring for a bonsai is more than a gardening technique: it is an exercise in life. Every pruning, every watering and every wait remind me that discipline and perseverance are the foundation of all growth. Bonsai teaches me patience and self-control, because results do not come immediately, but with constant dedication.",
    "filosofia_p2": "In each tree I find inspiration and passion, since its beauty reflects the care and love given to it day by day. For me, bonsai is a mirror of determination: an art that demands persistence, but rewards with harmony and balance. It is my way of connecting with nature and, at the same time, cultivating values that accompany me in every aspect of my life.",

It happened because every day, without exception, I was present.",
